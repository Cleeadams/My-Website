    <h1>Education Is Important To Me</h1>

        <div class="about-col">
            <h3>BS in Applied Mathematics</h3>
            <p>
                I Went to Cal Poly Pomona from 2016-2020 and received a Bachelor's Degree in
                Applied Mathematics. I learned how to think and formulate arguments in and out
                of the mathematical field. Some of my most influential instructors were
                Dr. Berit Givens, Dr. John Rock, Dr. Jennifer Switkes, and
                Dr. Nakashima. It wasn't only the subject material that I learned from them, but
                how to understand, read, and develop mathematical theories/ideas.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="about-col">
            <h3>MS in Applied Mathematics</h3>
            <p>
                During my Master's Program, I focused heavily on mathematical and statistical
                modeling. For my thesis, I researched and modeled the population growth of a pair
                of interactive species, Alaskan Brown Bears and Pacific Salmon, as their environmental
                climate changes. I have also participated in statistical modeling competitions and
                used machine learning to predict residential building prices and determine who survived
                disasters.

            <h3>Post Graduation</h3>
            <p>
                Now that I have received my Master's Degree, I am working toward becoming a
                machine learning engineer. I would like to begin by working as a data analyst where
                I can learn more about building and managing data pipelines. My time as a Graduate
                Teaching Associate gave me a passion for teaching, so if I can in the future, I
                would like to pursue a part-time career in teaching mathematics at a community college.

            <h3>Logistic Equations With Delay</h3>
            <p>Research in the stability of logistic equations with delay. Utilized MATLAB to
            observe solutions and design plots which presented when the delayed-logistic equation
            becomes unstable. came to the conclusion that the equilibrium of the population is
            the carry capacity.

            <h3>Coupled Systems Oscillators</h3>
            <p>Explored the stability of a single oscillator and coupled system oscillators
            using MATLAB. Discussed the similarities and differences between the two types of
            oscillators. Noticed that the coupled system experiences almost the same stable
            cycles as the single oscillator.

            <h3>Solutions Of a System With a Tridiagonal Matrix</h3>
            <p>Discovered solutions and the closed form for computing the eigenvalues for a
            specific type of tridiagonal matrix. Results showed that LU factorization and
            Gauss-Elimination w/o pivot were the best methods because of there efficiency with
            large tridiagonal matrices.</p>

            <h3>Minimum Distance Between Two Orbits</h3>
            <p>Utilize steepest decent method to find the minimum distance between two orbits.
            This was taken a step further by analysing the hessian which revealed the optimal
            direction to start steepest decent when the initial staring values reside on an
            inflection point.</p>
